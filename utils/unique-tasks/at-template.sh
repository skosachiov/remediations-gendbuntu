# One-liner that applies tasks to thousands of hosts (/tmp/hosts) under the timeout utility control.
# The script splits the list of hosts into chunks (25) and controls the execution of each chunk until the timeout (600s) expires.
# If the timeout is exceeded, the timeout utility kills the ansible-playbook on this iteration.
# This avoids stopping the ansible-playbook due to defunct friezes.
